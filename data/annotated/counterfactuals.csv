And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster. ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out. And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks. Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not. From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries. As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run. ""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country. ""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke."" Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments. So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped. ""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said. A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent, once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus used before adopting the euro in 2007.",pushing,saying,AFTER,1,"A Cyprus exit from the euro union, if it comes to that, would have a devastating effect on the country's citizens, who are among the most indebted in the euro zone. And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster. But for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out. And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks. Greece may well be too big to fail next year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, have certainly not. From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries. As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal has been sent that citizens and investors had to start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run. ""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole. He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia. Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day. ""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect. ""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop."" He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera. ""When there were dramas, there was a split problem.

The Department of Health and Human Services says that the law will ""make health-care coverage more affordable and accessible,"" pointing to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower. The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections suggests how complicated the law's effects will be.

The effects of the law will vary widely, and insurers and other analysts agree that some consumers and small businesses will likely see premiums go down.

CNN_20130322_1003,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced. Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding. The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said. State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department. Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence. ""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing. The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father. Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme. ""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility."" Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks. During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

nyt_20130321_china_pollution,"China's state leadership transition has taken place this month against an ominous backdrop. More than 16,000 dead pigs have been found floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City. So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him ""quite upset"" and vowed to ""show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts"" to clean it up. Last month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years.

AP_20130322,"The flu season is winding down, and it has killed 105 children so far - about the average toll. The season started about a month earlier than usual, sparking concerns it might turn into the worst in a decade. It ended up being very hard on the elderly, but was moderately severe overall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Six of the pediatric deaths were reported in the last week, and it's possible there will be more, said the CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung said Friday. Roughly 100 children die in an average flu season. One exception was the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, when 348 children died. The CDC recommends that all children ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu each season, though only about half get a flu shot or nasal spray. All but four of the children who died were old enough to be vaccinated, but 90 percent of them did not get vaccinated, CDC officials said. This year's vaccine was considered effective in children, though it didn't work very well in older people. And the dominant flu strain early in the season was one that tends to cause more severe illness. The government only does a national flu death count for children. But it does track hospitalization rates for people 65 and older, and those statistics have been grim. In that group, 177 out of every 100,000 were hospitalized with flu-related illness in the past several months. That's more than 2 1/2 times higher than any other recent season. This flu season started in early December, a month earlier than usual, and peaked by the end of year. Since then, flu reports have been dropping off throughout the country.

But a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially deployed by a major American military contractor is taking computing into the strange, subatomic realm of quantum mechanics. In that infinitesimal neighborhood, common sense logic no longer seems to apply. A one can be a one, or it can be a one and a zero and everything in between  all at the same time. It sounds preposterous, particularly to those familiar with the yes/no world of conventional computing. But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been working to develop quantum computers. Now, Lockheed Martin  which bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems two years ago  is confident enough in the technology to upgrade it to commercial scale, becoming the first company to use quantum computing as part of its business. Skeptics say that D-Wave has yet to prove to outside scientists that it has solved the myriad challenges involved in quantum computation. But if it performs as Lockheed and D-Wave expect, the design could be used to supercharge even the most powerful systems, solving some science and business problems millions of times faster than can be done today. Ray Johnson, Lockheeds chief technical officer, said his company would use the quantum computer to create and test complex radar, space and aircraft systems.

nyt_20130321_cyprus,"A Cyprus exit from the euro union, if it comes to that, would have a devastating effect on the country's citizens, who are among the most indebted in the euro zone. And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster. ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out. And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks. Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not. From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries. As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run. ""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros. Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country. ""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke."" Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments. So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped. ""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.
