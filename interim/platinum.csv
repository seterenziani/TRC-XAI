The call, which happened as President Barack Obama wrapped up his first presidential visit to Israel, was an unexpected outcome from a Mideast trip that seemed to yield few concrete steps.

Mr. Erdogan accepted the Israeli apology, the prime minister's office said.

Mr. Erdogan has long sought an apology for the raid in May 2010 on the Mavi Marmara, which was part of a flotilla that sought to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. An Israeli raid on the ship left nine passengers dead, all of them Turkish or of Turkish descent.

""In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation,"" the statement said.

Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Erdogan that what happened on board the Mavi Marmara was ""unintentional and Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life,"" according to the statement.

Mr. Obama said later at a news conference in Amman that he had spoken to both leaders over the past two years about how it was in the interests of both countries to restore normal relations.

He said he discussed the issue with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel this week, and that they agreed the timing was good for a discussion with the Turkish leader.

Mr. Erdogan has long sought an apology for the raid in May 2010 on the Mavi Marmara, which was part of a flotilla that sought to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. An Israeli raid on the ship left nine passengers dead, all of them Turkish or of Turkish descent.

""In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation,"" the statement said.

Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Erdogan that what happened on board the Mavi Marmara was ""unintentional and Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life,"" according to the statement.

Mr. Obama said later at a news conference in Amman that he had spoken to both leaders over the past two years about how it was in the interests of both countries to restore normal relations.

He said he discussed the issue with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel this week, and that they agreed the timing was good for a discussion with the Turkish leader.

The incident was a subject of talks between Mr. Netanyahu and President Barack Obama during the president's trip to Israel this week, officials said."

But a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially deployed by a major American military contractor is taking computing into the strange, subatomic realm of quantum mechanics. In that infinitesimal neighborhood, common sense logic no longer seems to apply. A one can be a one, or it can be a one and a zero and everything in between  all at the same time.

It sounds preposterous, particularly to those familiar with the yes/no world of conventional computing. But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been working to develop quantum computers.

Now, Lockheed Martin  which bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems two years ago  is confident enough in the technology to upgrade it to commercial scale, becoming the first company to use quantum computing as part of its business.

Skeptics say that D-Wave has yet to prove to outside scientists that it has solved the myriad challenges involved in quantum computation.

But if it performs as Lockheed and D-Wave expect, the design could be used to supercharge even the most powerful systems, solving some science and business problems millions of times faster than can be done today.

Ray Johnson, Lockheeds chief technical officer, said his company would use the quantum computer to create and test complex radar, space and aircraft systems. It could be possible, for example, to tell instantly how the millions of lines of software running a network of satellites would react to a solar burst or a pulse from a nuclear explosion  something that can now take weeks, if ever, to determine."

nyt_20130322_strange_computer,done,said,23,24,BEFORE,"Our digital age is all about bits, those precise ones and zeros that are the stuff of modern computer code.

But a powerful new type of computer that is about to be commercially deployed by a major American military contractor is taking computing into the strange, subatomic realm of quantum mechanics. In that infinitesimal neighborhood, common sense logic no longer seems to apply. A one can be a one, or it can be a one and a zero and everything in between  all at the same time.

It sounds preposterous, particularly to those familiar with the yes/no world of conventional computing. But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been working to develop quantum computers.

Now, Lockheed Martin  which bought an early version of such a computer from the Canadian company D-Wave Systems two years ago  is confident enough in the technology to upgrade it to commercial scale, becoming the first company to use quantum computing as part of its business.

Skeptics say that D-Wave has yet to prove to outside scientists that it has solved the myriad challenges involved in quantum computation.

During his tenure, he has increasingly unleashed biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries. These jokes are intended to do more than simply entertain you. They have an agenda.

And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster.

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out.

And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.

Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.

From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries.

As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run.

""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.

""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke.""

Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped.

""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.

That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.

""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke.""

Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped.

""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.

A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent, once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus used before adopting the euro in 2007."

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out.

Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped.

""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out.

And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.

Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.

From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries.

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out.

And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.

Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.

From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries.

As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run.

""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.

""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke.""

Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped.

""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.

A hasty expulsion from the euro zone would make the savings of the Cypriot people all the more evanescent, once they are converted back into Cypriot pounds, the currency Cyprus used before adopting the euro in 2007."

nyt_20130321_women_senate,gathered,slipped,1000009,2,AFTER,"An hour before her colleagues gathered for their first vote of a new Congress, Senator Kelly Ayotte slipped into an empty Senate chamber to savor the grandeur of her legislative home. As Ms. Ayotte, a freshman Republican from New Hampshire, sat down at the wooden desk where generations of lawmakers from her state had cast their votes, a doorman marched toward her with purpose.

The desks, he sternly told her, were for senators only.

Ms. Ayotte's induction that January day in 2011 into the most rarefied ranks of the nation's political class, female senators, had begun. ""The desk thing really stuck with me,"" Ms. Ayotte said. ""There still just aren't that many of us.""

In the 90 years since Rebecca Felton of Georgia became the first woman in the United States Senate - sworn in for a mere 24 hours - women remain an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have morphed from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th century into an important new force on key committees and legislation.

A record nine women now lead committees, including some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly dominated by men.

""We are growing in number,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. ""But more importantly, we are growing in our power. When I first started just six years ago, it was unusual to have a woman managing a bill.""

Just as important, even male senators say, is the potential the women hold for changing the tenor of the Senate and pushing for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

""I don't want to generalize, because this isn't true of all of them, but they tend to be interested in finding common ground,"" said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. ""So I think it's going to have, and is having, a positive impact on the Senate.""

While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have begun to crack away at the gridlock by forming coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, led the repeal in the Senate of ""don't ask, don't tell"" in 2010, allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military.

This year, all four of the female Senate Republicans split with their party and voted with Senate Democrats to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which had lapsed during the last Congress."

George Lowe, 89, died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness, with his wife Mary by his side.

New Zealand-born Mr Lowe was part of the team that helped Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a ""gentle soul and fine climber"" who shunned the limelight.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.

""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop.""

He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.

""When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?"" he said.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a ""hero"".

""I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one,"" he said.

A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be published in May.

He said: ""Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never sought the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition.

""He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet remained a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all.""

Before retiring in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a ""gentle soul and fine climber"" who shunned the limelight.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.

""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop.""

He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.

""When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?"" he said.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a ""hero"".

""I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one,"" he said.

A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be published in May.

He said: ""Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never sought the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition.

""He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet remained a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all.""

Before retiring in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage.

George Lowe, 89, died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness, with his wife Mary by his side.

New Zealand-born Mr Lowe was part of the team that helped Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a ""gentle soul and fine climber"" who shunned the limelight.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.

""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop.""

He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.

""When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?"" he said.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a ""hero"".

""I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one,"" he said.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a ""gentle soul and fine climber"" who shunned the limelight.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.

""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop.""

He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.

""When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?"" he said.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a ""hero"".

""I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one,"" he said.

A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be published in May.

He said: ""Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never sought the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition.

""He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet remained a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all.""

Before retiring in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage.

It said it ""expected to return to BP shareholders an amount equivalent to the value of the company's original investment in TNK-BP"".

It invested in TNK-BP in 2003.

BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said: ""We expect our stake in Rosneft will generate long-term value for BP and its shareholders. But this buyback programme should also allow our shareholders to see benefits in the near-term from the value we have realised by reshaping our Russian business.""

BP expects the share buyback programme could take between 12 and 18 months to complete.

Although BP's involvement in the Russian joint venture has been lucrative, relations with its partners have often been fraught with disagreement. In 2011, the AAR consortium attempted to block a drilling joint venture in the Arctic between BP and Rosneft through the courts and the plan was eventually dropped.

As well as internal wrangles, BP employees at TNK-BP have fallen foul of Russian authorities.

While serving as head of TNK-BP, Bob Dudley - now the head of BP as a whole - had his office bugged and raided by the police and met with onerous back-tax demands, legal action and visa problems.

He eventually fled the country in 2008.

BP agreed to sell back its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Russia's Rosneft in October in return for $17.1bn in cash and shares.

It invested in TNK-BP in 2003.

BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said: ""We expect our stake in Rosneft will generate long-term value for BP and its shareholders. But this buyback programme should also allow our shareholders to see benefits in the near-term from the value we have realised by reshaping our Russian business.""

BP expects the share buyback programme could take between 12 and 18 months to complete.

""In 2003 BP invested around $8bn in cash, shares and assets in the formation of TNK-BP,"" the oil giant said. ""Over the following decade BP received a total of $19bn in dividends from the joint venture.""

Although BP's involvement in the Russian joint venture has been lucrative, relations with its partners have often been fraught with disagreement. In 2011, the AAR consortium attempted to block a drilling joint venture in the Arctic between BP and Rosneft through the courts and the plan was eventually dropped.

As well as internal wrangles, BP employees at TNK-BP have fallen foul of Russian authorities.

While serving as head of TNK-BP, Bob Dudley - now the head of BP as a whole - had his office bugged and raided by the police and met with onerous back-tax demands, legal action and visa problems.

He eventually fled the country in 2008.

But the tie-up with Rosneft will keep BP in Russia, allowing it to continue to explore and exploit the country's vast energy resources, including in the Arctic region. And Rosneft benefits from BP's expertise in exploring in difficult and potentially hazardous conditions."

WSJ_20130322_804,warning,projecting,1,2002,EQUAL,"Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could increase sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul law, with the nation's biggest firm projecting that rates could more than double for some consumers buying their own plans.

The projections, made in sessions with brokers and agents, provide some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might increase prices when major provisions of the law kick in next year - a subject of rigorous debate.

The projected increases are at odds with what the Obama Administration says consumers should be expecting overall in terms of cost. The Department of Health and Human Services says that the law will ""make health-care coverage more affordable and accessible,"" pointing to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower.

The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections suggests how complicated the law's effects will be. Carriers will be filing proposed prices with regulators over the next few months.

Part of the murkiness stems from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will help lower-income consumers defray costs, but they are generally not included in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be getting more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The effects of the law will vary widely, and insurers and other analysts agree that some consumers and small businesses will likely see premiums go down.

Starting next year, the law will block insurers from refusing to sell coverage or setting premiums based on people's health histories, and will reduce their ability to set rates based on age. That can raise coverage prices for younger, healthier consumers, while reining them in for older, sicker ones. The rules can also affect small businesses, which sometimes pay premiums tied to employees' health status and claims history."

WSJ_20130318_731,broke,released,1,2,AFTER,"Microsoft Corp. broke sales records in 2010 when it released its Kinect - a movement-tracking device that enabled Xbox users to play their favorite games through gestures alone, without need of a controller.

Now, with the help of outside developers, the software giant is hoping to move the Kinect beyond gaming.

Microsoft is expanding into China with a company-funded incubator program for outside developers to build products based on Kinect technology for a range of industries including health care and retail.

In the U.S., 11 companies were selected last year for the accelerator's first three-month class in Seattle, out of nearly 500 applicants. Microsoft said it has identified three companies for the China program to run through June.

The company gives each participating startup in the Seattle program $20,000 to create software that can be used with Kinect for Windows, but it is isn't asking for any ownership stakes or intellectual property rights. Microsoft also doesn't have any veto power over the ideas.

CNN_20130322_1003,accused,faking,1,2,AFTER,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

""He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,"" he said."

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

CNN_20130322_1003,pleaded,announced,3,5,BEFORE,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

CNN_20130322_1003,speeding,discovered,1000,14,AFTER,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

""He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,"" he said."

CNN_20130322_1003,thought,uncovered,31,36,BEFORE,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

CNN_20130322_1003,reported,missing,41,42,AFTER,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

The season started about a month earlier than usual, sparking concerns it might turn into the worst in a decade. It ended up being very hard on the elderly, but was moderately severe overall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Six of the pediatric deaths were reported in the last week, and it's possible there will be more, said the CDC's Dr. Michael Jhung said Friday.

Roughly 100 children die in an average flu season. One exception was the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, when 348 children died.

The CDC recommends that all children ages 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu each season, though only about half get a flu shot or nasal spray.

All but four of the children who died were old enough to be vaccinated, but 90 percent of them did not get vaccinated, CDC officials said.

This year's vaccine was considered effective in children, though it didn't work very well in older people. And the dominant flu strain early in the season was one that tends to cause more severe illness.

The government only does a national flu death count for children. But it does track hospitalization rates for people 65 and older, and those statistics have been grim.

In that group, 177 out of every 100,000 were hospitalized with flu-related illness in the past several months. That's more than 2 1/2 times higher than any other recent season.

This flu season started in early December, a month earlier than usual, and peaked by the end of year. Since then, flu reports have been dropping off throughout the country.

More than 16,000 dead pigs have been found floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him ""quite upset"" and vowed to ""show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts"" to clean it up.

Last month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. ""China's air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level,"" the analysts said, calling for drastic policy changes and ""a strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups.""

State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. ""China's air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level,"" the analysts said, calling for drastic policy changes and ""a strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups.""

And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

Last month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade.

The torment of enduring that wait can paste a cancer patient to the couch, a surrender heavily associated with deadlier outcomes. Some seek escape in their careers, but that is no longer an option for Leon, who early this year was forced to step down as a juvenile probation officer in Travis County, Texas, a position he had held for almost seven years. His thinking is no longer clear, said Leon, adding, ""I was making too many mistakes on the stand.""

But Leon can still run. Two years after his brain-cancer diagnosis, he recently ran a sub-five-minute mile for the first time since high school. What has startled the medical community even more is what Leon did this month in Beaumont, Texas. He won the Gusher Marathon, finishing in 3:07:35.

The US embassy in Moscow has voiced concern and asked the Russian government for an explanation.

A new Russian law says foreign-funded non-governmental groups (NGOs) linked to politics must register as ""foreign agents"" - a term which suggests spying.

Memorial says inspectors returned to its Moscow offices on Friday, having already seized 600 documents including accounts on Thursday.

A statement on the Memorial website said the inspections were directly linked to the new law on NGOs and the targeted groups' compliance with it.

He insisted that the NGO law ""will not change our position at all"". ""We won't refuse foreign donations, nor will we register as a 'foreign agent',"" he said."

The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East.

It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president's Middle East swing. It is the first foreign trip of his second term.

A statement from Netanyahu's office said the apology included an offer of compensation. However, there was confusion later when the Israeli government dropped a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a return of ambassadors.

There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the flotilla raid.

Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement omitted that action as well."

CNN_20130322_1243,settling,took,7,9,AFTER,"Before the arrival of Keep, which Google launched this week, there was no default note-taking app for Android. It was a glaring hole, considering that Apple's iPhone has built-in Notes and Reminders apps that can be powered by Siri.

Instead of settling for a bare bones app to fill the void, the search giant took things one step further. Keep isn't simply just a place to bank whatever random half-thoughts come to mind: Users can construct to-do lists, stash photos, and color code your notes -- all in one well-designed and easy-to-use interface.

The second you log anything into your phone, it is also accessible from a PC Web browser via Google Drive. Alternatively, you can save things while working on your computer, and it will instantly appear on your phone, ready for use while on the go.

The design may not be as progressive as the to-do app Clear, but Keep makes up for that in its simplicity and efficiency.

Everything in Keep is presented like a Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) Windows Phone-esque stream of tiles. Swiping left or right will archive those notes you no longer need (but don't want to erase entirely). At the top of the app is a text entry field that serves as your main point of entry for all new notes. And when viewing any specific note, tapping any part of that note (title, body, etc.) will allow you to edit it. The entire experience is frictionless.

That said, it's not going to conquer the world quite yet. Organization options are limited -- color coding is your only choice, and you can't re-order your notes. Sharing with others is mostly limited to email and Google+, and the desktop features are pretty bare bones.

But that's more a function of it being new, rather than poorly thought out. Like most things Google, expect the company to flesh out Keep over time and really turn it into our personal internet junk drawer.

It's easy to foresee the day the when users will be able to send anything from their Web browser or Maps directly to Keep. The prospect of Keep incorporating features of services such as Pinterest or Pocket, or even making it easy to catalog streaming media, could turn it into something big. That should scare Evernote.

Keep is not the reinvention of the wheel in any aspect -- there are a plethora of third-party apps already available for Android. But it is a well-exectuted refinement.

In filling a minor, but important gap in its mobile ecosystem, Google gives the competition one less claim of superiority over Android."

The FAA had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low- or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors. Before Friday's announcement, it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the ""national interest"" to do so.

By congressional mandate, the FAA must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget this fiscal year. Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers, it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers, the agency says."

The call, which happened as President Barack Obama wrapped up his first presidential visit to Israel, was an unexpected outcome from a Mideast trip that seemed to yield few concrete steps.

Mr. Netanyahu's office confirmed that the Israeli leader, in a conversation with Mr. Erdogan, ""agreed to restore normalization between Israel and Turkey, including the dispatch of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal steps against [Israeli Defense Forces] soldiers."" Mr. Erdogan accepted the Israeli apology, the prime minister's office said.

Mr. Erdogan has long sought an apology for the raid in May 2010 on the Mavi Marmara, which was part of a flotilla that sought to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. An Israeli raid on the ship left nine passengers dead, all of them Turkish or of Turkish descent.

""In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Prime Minister Netanyahu apologized to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation,"" the statement said.

Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Erdogan that what happened on board the Mavi Marmara was ""unintentional and Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life,"" according to the statement.

Mr. Obama said later at a news conference in Amman that he had spoken to both leaders over the past two years about how it was in the interests of both countries to restore normal relations.

He said he discussed the issue with Mr. Netanyahu during his visit to Israel this week, and that they agreed the timing was good for a discussion with the Turkish leader.

The incident was a subject of talks between Mr. Netanyahu and President Barack Obama during the president's trip to Israel this week, officials said."

It sounds preposterous, particularly to those familiar with the yes/no world of conventional computing. But academic researchers and scientists at companies like Microsoft, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard have been working to develop quantum computers.

And for European unity and diplomacy, the Cyprus debacle has already been at least a short-term disaster.

ut for the broader financial system in Europe, the losses resulting from a Cypriot banking collapse and the country's return to its former currency would be minimal compared with the havoc that Greece would have created had it not been bailed out.

And that, economists and investors contend, is why Germany and its Dutch stalking horse, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, were so adamant that depositors - large and small, Cypriot and Russian - contribute 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) toward the 10 billion euro bailout of Cyprus's largest banks.

Greece may well have been too big to fail last year, but Cyprus, which creates less than one-half percent of the euro zone's gross domestic product, is certainly not.

From a financial standpoint, what is most noteworthy is that the combined debt of the Cypriot people, companies and government is 2.6 times the size of the country's gross domestic product. Only Ireland, still struggling to recover from the banking collapse that required an international bailout in 2010, has a higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratio among euro zone countries.

As debts in Europe mount in inverse proportion to the ability of its citizens, companies and governments to make good on them, the view is forming in Berlin and Brussels that a signal must be sent that citizens and investors must start accepting losses for the euro zone to survive in the long run.

""There have been too many bailouts in Europe; it's time to remove the air bags,"" said Stephen Jen, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who runs a hedge fund in London. ""This is not a Lehman,"" he said, referring to the disastrous chain reaction touched off by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.

Eric Dor is a French economist who has studied the mechanics of how a country might remove itself from the monetary union. By his calculations, the euro zone - through its central banking system and its national banks - has just 27 billion euros in outstanding credit exposure to Cyprus. That is a mere rounding error compared with the euro zone G.D.P. of 9.4 trillion euros.

Estimates of the potential cost if Greece had been forced into a disorderly euro exit have ranged from 200 billion euros to 800 billion euros, given the larger exposure that the European Central Bank and European banks had to the country.

""This explains why Germany and others are putting so much pressure on Cyprus,"" said Mr. Dor, head of research at the Ieseg School of Management in Lille, France. ""They are saying we can take the risk of pushing Cyprus out of the euro zone, and that Europe can take the losses without going broke.""

Mr. Dor notes that the current euro zonewide system of insuring bank deposits up to 100,000 euros was put in place after the financial panic that followed the Lehman collapse. Those deposits are supposed to be insured by national governments.

So when the president of Cyprus admitted this week that his country did not have the money to backstop the 30 billion euros of guaranteed bank deposits - a figure greater than the Cypriot economy itself - a crucial bond of trust between a government and its citizens was snapped.

""It is the first time ever that the leader of a euro zone country has admitted that he could not afford to pay the guarantee,"" Mr. Dor said.

Benjamin Netanyahu also agreed with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan to compensate the families of the nine activists who were killed.

Mr Netanyahu had previously only expressed regret for the deaths.

The deal was brokered by US President Barack Obama during a visit to Israel.

Mr Erdogan's office said he had accepted the apology, ""in the name of the Turkish people"".

In the past, he has always given two conditions for restoring bilateral relations with Israel - an apology and compensation for victims' families.

Nine people were killed on board the Turkish aid ship, Mavi Marmara, when it was boarded by Israeli commandos while trying to transport aid supplies to Gaza in May 2010 in spite of an Israeli naval blockade.

The Israeli government admitted mistakes were made in intelligence-gathering and planning, but insisted its commandos used lethal force because activists had attacked them.

The activists said the troops had opened fire as soon as they boarded the vessel, which was in international waters at the time.

The incident provoked an international outcry and led to a major deterioration in relations between Turkey and Israel.

Before departing for Jordan on Friday afternoon, Mr Obama revealed that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Erdogan had just spoken by telephone."

In the 90 years since Rebecca Felton of Georgia became the first woman in the United States Senate - sworn in for a mere 24 hours - women remain an anomaly in the upper chamber. But with 20 female senators now in office, an all-time high, women have morphed from the curiosity they were for much of the 20th century into an important new force on key committees and legislation.

A record nine women now lead committees, including some of the most powerful ones. For the first time there is a woman - Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat - in charge of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which dispenses billions of dollars annually throughout the government and has long been particularly dominated by men. Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, is the first chairwoman of the Budget Committee and is charged with shaping the Democratic strategy in the fiscal battle dominating Capitol Hill.

One of the biggest bills to pass the Senate last year was farm legislation led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who presides over the agriculture committee. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, shepherded the highway bill.

""We are growing in number,"" said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. ""But more importantly, we are growing in our power. When I first started just six years ago, it was unusual to have a woman managing a bill.""

Just as important, even male senators say, is the potential the women hold for changing the tenor of the Senate and pushing for compromise in the highly partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill.

""I don't want to generalize, because this isn't true of all of them, but they tend to be interested in finding common ground,"" said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. ""So I think it's going to have, and is having, a positive impact on the Senate.""

While partisan division is the central characteristic of the modern Congress, women have begun to crack away at the gridlock by forming coalitions that have surprised leaders of both parties. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, led the repeal in the Senate of ""don't ask, don't tell"" in 2010, allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military.

George Lowe, 89, died in Ripley on Wednesday after a long-term illness, with his wife Mary by his side.

New Zealand-born Mr Lowe was part of the team that helped Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the summit in 1953.

Family friend and historian Dr Huw Lewis-Jones paid tribute to a ""gentle soul and fine climber"" who shunned the limelight.

Mr Lowe also took part in the trans-Antarctic expedition of 1957-58, which made the first successful overland crossing of Antarctica via the South Pole.

He later made expeditions to Greenland, Greece and Ethiopia.

Speaking to the BBC in 1995, Mr Lowe said of his Antarctic adventure: ""We estimated we could do it in 100 days, and we got across on the 99th day.

""There was a great feeling of euphoria from everyone. It had a multiplying effect.

""We were pleased that England and New Zealand knew about it, and we thought that's where it would stop.""

He also talked about his ""second job"" as the group's cameraman, and having to wear four pairs of gloves to work the clockwork camera.

""When there were dramas, there was a split problem. Do you take part in the urgency - or do you record it?"" he said.

Dr Lewis-Jones, the former curator at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who first met Mr Lowe in 2005, called him a ""hero"".

""I don't often use that word but then it is not very often that you get to meet one,"" he said.

A book of memoirs and photographs from the climb by Mr Lowe, which he worked on with Dr Lewis-Jones, is due to be published in May.

He said: ""Lowe was a brilliant, kind fellow who never sought the limelight... and 60 years on from Everest his achievements deserve wider recognition.

""He was involved in two of the most important explorations of the 20th Century... yet remained a humble, happy man right to the end... an inspirational lesson to us all.""

Before retiring in 1984, Mr Lowe worked as an Inspector of Schools with the Department of Education and Sciences, and he leaves three sons from a previous marriage.

The last British climbing member of the 1953 team, Mike Westmacott, died last June."

It said it ""expected to return to BP shareholders an amount equivalent to the value of the company's original investment in TNK-BP"".

BP agreed to sell back its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Russia's Rosneft in October in return for $17.1bn in cash and shares.

It invested in TNK-BP in 2003.

BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said: ""We expect our stake in Rosneft will generate long-term value for BP and its shareholders. But this buyback programme should also allow our shareholders to see benefits in the near-term from the value we have realised by reshaping our Russian business.""

BP expects the share buyback programme could take between 12 and 18 months to complete.

""In 2003 BP invested around $8bn in cash, shares and assets in the formation of TNK-BP,"" the oil giant said. ""Over the following decade BP received a total of $19bn in dividends from the joint venture.""

Although BP's involvement in the Russian joint venture has been lucrative, relations with its partners have often been fraught with disagreement. In 2011, the AAR consortium attempted to block a drilling joint venture in the Arctic between BP and Rosneft through the courts and the plan was eventually dropped.

As well as internal wrangles, BP employees at TNK-BP have fallen foul of Russian authorities.

While serving as head of TNK-BP, Bob Dudley - now the head of BP as a whole - had his office bugged and raided by the police and met with onerous back-tax demands, legal action and visa problems.

He eventually fled the country in 2008.

WSJ_20130322_804,projecting,warning,1,2002,EQUAL,"Health insurers are privately warning brokers that premiums for many individuals and small businesses could increase sharply next year because of the health-care overhaul law, with the nation's biggest firm projecting that rates could more than double for some consumers buying their own plans.

The projections, made in sessions with brokers and agents, provide some of the most concrete evidence yet of how much insurance companies might increase prices when major provisions of the law kick in next year - a subject of rigorous debate.

The projected increases are at odds with what the Obama Administration says consumers should be expecting overall in terms of cost. The Department of Health and Human Services says that the law will ""make health-care coverage more affordable and accessible,"" pointing to a 2009 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that says average individual premiums, on an apples-to-apples basis, would be lower.

The gulf between the pricing talk from some insurers and the government projections suggests how complicated the law's effects will be. Carriers will be filing proposed prices with regulators over the next few months.

Part of the murkiness stems from the role of government subsidies. Federal subsidies under the health law will help lower-income consumers defray costs, but they are generally not included in insurers' premium projections. Many consumers will be getting more generous plans because of new requirements in the law. The effects of the law will vary widely, and insurers and other analysts agree that some consumers and small businesses will likely see premiums go down.

Starting next year, the law will block insurers from refusing to sell coverage or setting premiums based on people's health histories, and will reduce their ability to set rates based on age. That can raise coverage prices for younger, healthier consumers, while reining them in for older, sicker ones. The rules can also affect small businesses, which sometimes pay premiums tied to employees' health status and claims history."

CNN_20130322_1003,uncovered,told,30,36,EQUAL,"A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced.

Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding.

The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said.

State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department.

Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence.

""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing.

The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father.

Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme.

""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility.""

Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks.

During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said.

On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

""He would like to straighten things out with (Jonathan) when the time comes,"" he said."

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him ""quite upset"" and vowed to ""show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts"" to clean it up.

Last month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

On Feb. 28, Deutsche Bank released an analysts' note saying that China's current economic policies would result in an enormous surge in coal consumption and automobile sales over the next decade. ""China's air pollution will become a lot worse from the already unbearable level,"" the analysts said, calling for drastic policy changes and ""a strong government will to overcome the opposition from interest groups.""

More than 16,000 dead pigs have been found floating in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai. A haze akin to volcanic fumes cloaked the capital, causing convulsive coughing and obscuring the portrait of Mao Zedong on the gate to the Forbidden City.

So severe are China's environmental woes, especially the noxious air, that top government officials have been forced to openly acknowledge them. Fu Ying, the spokeswoman for the National People's Congress, said she checked for smog every morning after opening her curtains and kept at home face masks for her daughter and herself. Li Keqiang, the new prime minister, said the air pollution had made him ""quite upset"" and vowed to ""show even greater resolve and make more vigorous efforts"" to clean it up.

Last month, after deadly air pollution hit record levels in northern China, officials led byWen Jiabao, then the prime minister, put forward strict new fuel standards that the oil companies had blocked for years. But there are doubts about whether the oil companies will comply, especially since oil officials resisted a similar government order for higher-grade fuel four years ago. State-owned power companies have been similarly resistant. The companies regularly ignore government orders to upgrade coal-burning electricity plants, according to ministry data. And as with the oil companies, the power companies exert an outsize influence over environmental policy debates.

In 2011, during a round of discussions over stricter emissions standards, the China Electricity Council, which represents the companies, pushed back hard against the proposals, saying that the costs of upgrading the plants would be too high.

Mr. Sarkozy has denied accepting illegal campaign funds from Ms. Bettencourt, either personally or through his party treasurer at the time, Eric Woerth, as alleged by her former butler. Mr. Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, called the judge's decision, which indicates that the judge believes that Mr. Sarkozy probably committed a crime, ""incoherent"" and ""unjust."" The lawyer said he would appeal. The ruling does not necessarily mean that Mr. Sarkozy, who lost his re-election bid last May and with it his presidential immunity from prosecution, will stand trial."

The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East.

It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president's Middle East swing. It is the first foreign trip of his second term.

A statement from Netanyahu's office said the apology included an offer of compensation. However, there was confusion later when the Israeli government dropped a reference in its original statement to normalized relations between the countries with a return of ambassadors.

There also was no word on whether the once-close nations would resume the joint military exercises that were suspended after the flotilla raid.

Turkey had been prosecuting four Israeli soldiers in absentia and Israel initially said the two leaders agreed to the cancellation of legal steps against the troops. Later, however, its amended statement omitted that action as well."

CNN_20130322_248,said,sparing,3,7,EQUAL,"The FAA on Friday announced it will close 149 regional airport control towers because of forced spending cuts -- sparing 40 others that the FAA had been expected to shutter.

A four-week, phased closure of the 149 control towers will begin on April 7, the FAA said.

The FAA had been expected to announce the closure of 189 low- or moderate-volume towers staffed by contractors. Before Friday's announcement, it said it would consider keeping a tower open if the airport convinces the agency it is in the ""national interest"" to do so.

By congressional mandate, the FAA must cut nearly $600 million from its nearly $48 billion budget this fiscal year. Because the majority of its 47,000 employees are air traffic controllers, it is impossible to cut its budget without affecting controllers, the agency says."
